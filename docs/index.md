- Is it frustrating to be in trouble of the high damage taken by enemies in a dark night? Would it be nice to kill monsters smartly with less time and resources? Finding the best way to beat enemies with the lowest resource and damage taken cost is not easy for new Minecraft players, but we can use AI to learn an optimal policy to kill monsters.
- In Monster Killer project, we place a Minecraft agent in an open plain terrain with one hostile mob and multiple available weapons to let the agent kill the mob with least count of actions and health costs.
The application of this project serves as a guide for players in survival mode. For new players, it teaches them how to beat - - monsters efficiently. For advanced players, it helps them to beat more powerful enemies and bosses.
